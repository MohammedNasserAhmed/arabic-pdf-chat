## Technologies Used 🛠️  
- **Python Libraries**:  
  - [Gradio](https://gradio.app/): User-friendly UI for interaction.  
  - [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/): PDF text extraction.  
  - [pytesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract): OCR for PDFs.  
  - [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain): Framework for conversational AI with retrieval-based querying.  
  - [gTTS](https://github.com/pndurette/gTTS): Arabic text-to-speech functionality.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - **LLMs**: Powered by [ChatGroq](https://www.groq.com/) using the `gemma2-9b-it` model.  
  - **Embeddings**: Utilizes [sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers).  
- **Vector Store**: FAISS for efficient similarity search and retrieval.

## Getting Started 🚀  

### Prerequisites 📋  
Ensure you have:  
- Python 3.9+  
- `pip` for package management  
- Access to API keys:  
  - `GROQ_API_KEY`  
  - `HF_TOKEN`  

### Installation ⚙️  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/arabic-pdf-chat.git
   cd arabic-chat-with-pdf
   ```  
2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:  
   Create a `.env` file and add the required API keys:  
   ```env
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
   ```  

### Run the Application 🖥️  
Launch the app with:  
```bash
python app.py
```  
The Gradio interface will open in your browser.

## ETL Process 🔄  
The system follows a structured **ETL pipeline**:  
1. **Extract**: Reads Arabic PDFs using OCR (`pytesseract`) and `PyPDF2`.  
2. **Transform**:  
   - Splits text into manageable chunks with `CharacterTextSplitter`.  
   - Converts raw text into vector embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.  
3. **Load**: Stores transformed data in a FAISS vector database for efficient retrieval.  

---

## Limitations ⚠️  
- **File Size**: Limited to PDFs under 10 MB.  
- **Language Support**: Optimized only for Arabic text. Non-Arabic content is not supported.  
- **Scanned Documents**: OCR may struggle with low-quality scans.  
- **Performance**: Response times may vary depending on document size and complexity.
